                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                    
                    
                    <strong>Document Object Model</strong> - An API that has a HTML, XHTML, or XML doc represented as a tree structure <strong>wherein each node is an object</strong> representing part of the document. <br /><br />
                    Established in 1998 by Tim Berners-Lee aka the WWWC.<br /><br />
                    
                    Any visual changes occuring as a result may then be reflected in the display of the document.<br /><br />
                    
                    Javascript (and something called JScript) was the first thing to let web devs create pages w client-side interactivity.<br /><br />
                    
                    The DOM was essentially created to give devs a way to interact with the parts of an HTML doc, to modify it as well, because there wasn't one yet.<br /><br />
                    
                    So the DOM is just "the standard" and an API that must be understood in order to interact with the elements therein.<br /><br />
    
                   When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a D O M of the page, which is an OO representation of an HTML document. <br /><br />
    
                   Most web browsers basically use the DOM to render a doc like an HTML page. <br /><br />
    
                   The top-most node is the Document Object - all obejects have their prototypes so programatically speaking it's safe to assume that any node in the DOM is represented as an object that has a prototype which follows some possibly arbitray prototype inheritance chain. That chain all heads to null which is the only object without its prototype.
    
     
                 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>DOM Levels</h3>
                    
                    DOM level 0 -  Didn't actually exist formally. <br /><br />
                    
                    DOM level 1 - Finally provided a complete model for an entire HTML / XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document, via Javascript.<br /><br />
                    
                    
                    DOM level 2 - Published in late 2000. Introduced the getElementById function as well as an event model, AND support for XML namespaces, and CSS.<br /><br />
                    
                    
                    DOM level 3 - Published in 2004. Added support for XPath and Keyboard Event Handling, as well as an interface for serializing docs as XML.<br /><br />
                    
                    
                    DOM level 4 - Published in 2015 - It's  snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.<br /><br />
    
                <!--Event listener - Attached to element to listen for interaction (mouseclick etc)-->
                <h3>DOM Events</h3>
                <strong>Event</strong> - anything the user does to interact with the page. <br /><br />
                <strong>UI events</strong> - extends the DOM Event objects defined in the DOM.<br /><br />
    
                <strong>Event delegation</strong> - JS event listeners fire on a DOM element AND all its descendants.<br /><br />
                <strong>Event bubbling</strong> - inverse of delegation: events on an element will “bubble” up to parents.<br /><br />
    
                Each available event has an <strong>event handler</strong> - a block of code, usually user-defined JS function, that will be run when the event fires.<br /><br />
                When defining these blocks of code, it's registering an event handler.
    
                Event handler <-> event listener (more or less interchangeable).<br /><br />

            <h2 id="cssBox">Box Model</h2>

              <p>
              
              All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The term "box model" is used when talking about a. Design and b. Layout.
              <br /><br />
              It wraps around every HTML element.
              </p>
              <strong>content</strong> - The innermost layer containing text or other elements of the target element <br /><br />	
              <strong>padding</strong> - the layer just outside the content layer. The padding is transparent.
              More padding gives visual effect of increasing the size of the content layer. <br /><br />
                
              <strong>border</strong> - 
              the layer surrounding padding. Most of the time has a small width of maybe only 1 pixel. 
              Unlike padding and margin layers, this layer can be given color and style.	<br /><br />
              
              <strong>margin</strong> - the outermost layer between the target element and its parent element. The margin is transparent. <br />
              Adding space to the margin gives the visual effect of increasing the content size of the parent element. <br /><br />
              
              When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. <br />
              To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins. <br /><br />
              
              total element width = (width) + (left + right padding) + (left + right border) + (left + right margin) <br /><br />
              
              total element height = (height) + (top + bottom padding) + (top + bottom border) + (top + bottom margin) <br /><br />
                  
            <h2 id="cssVar">CSS Variables and Custom Properties</h2>
              
              <strong>CSS variables</strong> - entities containing specific values to be reused throughout a document.
              <br /><br />	
              They're set using custom property notation (ex. —main-color: black;i).<br />
              They're accessed using the var() function (ex. var(—main-color);). <br /><br />
              
              Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS, often with a lot of repeated values. <br />
              The same color might be used in hundreds of different places, requiring global search and replace if that color needs to be changed. <br /><br />
              
              Variables address the problem that CSS is mostly a declarative language that lacks dynamic capabilities. <br />
              
              <h3>CSS Variables vs. Preprocessor Variables</h3>
              
              <p>
              CSS variables are live CSS properties running in the browser, while preprocessor variables that have to get compiled into regular CSS code, therefore the browser knows nothing about them.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              What this means is you can update CSS variables in a stylesheet document, inside the inline style attributes and SVG presentational attributes of an HTML file, or choose to manipulate them on the fly using Javascript. You can't do this with preprocessor variables.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              CSS variables allow for one canonical declaration of a CSS property (that  can be referenced throughout, and then changed at the root as desired to update across the whole stylesheet). <br /><br />
              
              If no value is set for a custom property on a given element then the value of its parent is used.
              </p>
            
            
            <h3>CSS Variable Syntax:</h3>
              
              <code>
              —my-background: #000;
              </code>
              
              1. prefix the custom property with two dashes, <br />
              2. assign it a value like a regular CSS property <br /><br />
              
              The value is referenced using var(), and is scoped inside a CSS selector:
              <code>
              :root{
              —my-background: #000;
              }
              /* rest of the CSS file */
              #foo{
              background-color: var(—my-background);
              }
              </code>
              
              <h3>Use CSS Variables in Javascript</h3>
              
              It's the same as standard properties like background-position: <br /><br />
              
              If you have:
              <code>
              :root{
                —mouse-x: 10px;
                —mouse-y: 10px;
              }
              </code>
              
              Then to update those values from JS you'd use:
              <code>
              let root = document.documentElement
              
              root.addEventListener("mousemove"m e=> {
                root.style.setProperty('—mouse-x', e.clientX + "px");
                root.style.setProperty('mouse-y', e.clientY + "px");
              });
              </code>
              
              <h3>Nesting CSS Variables</h3>
              
              You can set the value of a CSS variable with another CSS variable, ex.:
              
              <code>
              :root{
              —top-color: orange;
              —bottom-color: yellow;
              
              —my-gradient: linear-gradient(var(—top-color), var(—bottom-color));
              }
              </code>
            
            <h3>CSS Variables with SVGs</h3>
              
              You can use CSS variables to modify both a. style and b. presentational attributes inside inline SVGs.
              <br /><br />
              Ex.:
              <code>
              svg
              symbol id="close-icon" viewbox 0 0 200 200
              circle cx="96" cy="96" r="88" fill="none" stroke="var(—icon-color)" stroke-width="15"
              /symbol
              /svg
              </code>
            
            
            <h2 id="cssMedia">Media Queries</h2>
              
              Adjust styles according to factors like:
              
              <li>device used,</li>
              <li>viewport size, </li>
              <li>screen's pixel density</li>
              <li>device orientation</li>
            
            
            <h3>Optimize Text For Reading:</h3>
              <p>
              An ideal column should contain 70-80 characters per line, or about 8 to 10 words in English. So, <strong>each time the width of a text block grows past 10 words, consider adding a breakpoint.</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Don't define breakpoints based on device classes - defining them based on specific devices or operating systems can result in a maintenance nightmare. Instead, the content itself should detemrine how the layout adjusts to its container. So, <strong>don't define breakpoints based on the device being used, but instead on the content!</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Can design for the smallest mobile device first: pick major breakpoints by starting small, then working up.<br />
              Try designing the content to fit on a small screen size first, then expand as breakpoints become necessary.
              <br /><br />
              *Use DevTools to view the various breakpoints:
              </p>
              
              1. Open DevTools and turn on Device Mode <br /><br />
              2. Use viewport controls to set to Responsive mode <br /><br />
              3. Click the three dots in the top right and select Show Media Queries <br /><br />
              
              <li>Queries that are blue-colored target a maximum width</li>
              <li>Green queries target widths within a range</li>
              <li>Orange queries target a minimum width</li> <br />
              
              <strong>Can even load different style sheets with different breakpoints depending on the browser size:</strong>
              <code>
              &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="weather.css"&gt; /*could be main styles -anything not media queried */
              &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 600px;)" href="weather-2-small.css"&gt;
              &lt;link rel=""stylesheet" media="(min-width: 600px;)" href="weather-2-large.css"&gt;
              </code>
              
              <strong>@media</strong> - used to define a media query, preceding a media type
              
            <h3>Media Types</h3>
              
              <li>all</li>
              <li>print</li>
              <li>screen</li>
              <li>speech</li>
              <li>When not specified, the type of all is implied</li>
              
              Multiple media types can be used at once, and are separated by commas:
              <code>
              @media screen, print{
                /*styles*/
              }
              </code>
            
            <h3>Media Features</h3>
              <p>
              Media features provide more specific details to media queries by allowing to test for a specific feature of the user agent or display device.
              </p>
              
              <li>max-width, min-width</li>
              <li>max height, min-height</li>
              <li>resolution (using dpi or dpcm)</li>
              <li>aspect-ratio</li>
              <li>orientation</li>
              <li>resolution</li>
              <br />

              <code>
              /*hide an element when the browser's width is 600px wide or less*/
              @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
                div.example{
                  display: none;
                }
              }
              </code>
              
              
              <strong>max</strong>-width = <strong>less</strong> than the amount, or the amount (think "up to" 700px with max-width: 700px). <br />
              <strong>min</strong>-width = <strong>more</strong> than the amount, or the amount (think "down to" 700px with min-width: 700px).
              <br /><br />
              Ex.:
              
              <code>
              //Set the background-color to lavender if the viewport is 800px or wider,
              //set to light green if between 400 and 799px,
              //or set to lightblue if smaller than 400px:
              
              body{
                background-color: lightblue;
              }
              
              media screen and (min-width: 400px){
                body {
                background-color: lightgreen;
                }
              }
              
              media screen and (min-width: 800px){
                body{
                background-color: lavender;
                }
              }
              </code>
            
            <h3>Media Queries with CSS Grid</h3>
              <strong>grid-template-areas</strong> - Allows you to write responsive layouts with a single rule inside a media query.
              <br /><br />
              
              It defines a <strong>visual grid</strong> system on both axes at once:
              <code>
              .user-profile__username{
                grid-area: name;
              }
              
              .user-profile__avatar{
                grid-area: avatar;
              }
              
              .user-profile__bio{
                grid-area: bio;
              }
              
              .grid{
                grid-template-areas:
                'avatar name'
                'bio    bio'
              }
              
              /* a simple media query will rearrange the grid template:*/
              @media (max-width: 700px){
                .grid{
                'name'
                'avatar'
                'bio';
                }
              }
              /*the children element of grid - name, avatar, and bio - will now stack vertically in a viewport up to 700px */
              </code>
              <p>
              The number of columns is inferred by the property values. <br />
              Each name separated by on or more spaces defines a column (and each row must define the same number of columns). <br /><br />
              </p>

            <h3>Easy Fluid Images</h3>
              
              Can set images on a website to:
              <code>
              img {
                    max-width: 100%;
              }
              </code>
              <p>
              Instead of rendering at its native width and therefore overflowing its containing box, the image will render at its native dimensions, as long as its width doesn't exceed the width of its container. </p>

              <strong>px</strong> - good at spacing and layout but are not a good fit for font-size. <br />
              <strong>em</strong> - values relative to the parent element. <br />
              If font-size of parent is 20px then 1 em = 20px. <br />
              So if the child element has 1.5 em then it would = 30px. <br />
              <strong>rem</strong> - values are relative to root html element instead of the parent element. <br />
              So, if font-size of the root element is 16px then 1 rem = 16px. <br />
              <strong>vw</strong> - relative to 1% of the width of the viewport. <br />
              If the viewport is 50cm wide, then 1vw = .5cm. <br />
              <strong>vh</strong> - relative to 1% of the height of the viewport <br />
              <strong>vmin</strong> - relative to 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension <br />
              <strong>vmax</strong> - relative to 1% of the viewport's larger dimensions <br />
              <strong>%</strong> - relative to the parent element <br />

            <h2 id="cssGrid">CSS Grid</h2>
                <p>CSS Grid - A CSS module that's most powerful layout system available in CSS.
                <br /><br />
                It's 2-dimensional system, meaning it handles both columns and rows, versus flexbox which is largely 1-dimensional.<br /><br />
                
                With Grid, you apply CSS rules to both a parent element, which becomes the Grid Container, and that element's children, which become Grid Items.

                </p> 
                
                <h3>Steps to setting up a grid</h3>
                <p>
                1. Define a container element as a grid with display: grid<br />
                2. Set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns/rows<br />
                3. Place the child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row. <br />
                
                ex.:
                
                <code>
                div class="container"
                  div class="item item-1"
                  div class="item item-2"
                  div class="item item-3"                              
                </code>
                </p><br />
                <li> Source order of the grid items doesn't matter - the CSS can place them in any order, making it easy to rearrange the grid with media queries.</ul>
                
                <li> With CSS Grid, you can define the layout of an entire page, then completely rearrange it to accomodate a different screen width, all with only a couple lines of CSS.
                
                <li> Except for IE, all browsers ship native, unprefixed support for Grid.
                
                <br /> <br />
                <h3>Using CSS Grid With Webpage Layouts</h3>
                <p>
                <Strong>grid-area</strong> - Gives an item a name so it can be referenced by a template created by the grid-template-areas property. <br />
                </p>
                Values: <br />
                <li><strong>name</strong> - your chosen name (i.e. "header")</li>
                <li><strong>row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end</strong> - can be numbers or named lines.</li>
                <code>
                .item {
                  grid-area: <strong>name</strong> | <strong>row-start</strong> / <strong>column-start</strong> / <strong>row-end</strong> / <strong>column-end</strong>;
                }
                </code>
                
                Example - Assigning a name to an item:
                <code>
                .item-d {
                  grid-area: header
                }
                </code>
                
                Example - Specifying an item's area using shorthand:
                
                <code>
                .item-d {
                  grid-area: 1 / col4-start / last-line / 6
                }
                </code>
                <p>Here's a visualization of the above code:</p>
                <img src="images/css-grid-example.png" height="300">

                <p><Strong>grid-template-area</strong> - Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas that are specified with the grid-area property:</p>

                <img src="images/css-grid-layout.png" height="300">
                  <br /> <br />
                  *Each row in the declaration needs to have the same number of cells.
                  
                <h3>CSS Grid Terminology</h3>

                <p>Grid Container - The element on which display: grid is applied.
                  </p>
                <p>Grid Item - The children, i.e. direct descendants of the container. In the following, the item elements are grid items, but the sub-item isn't:</p>

                <code>
                    div class="container"
                      div class="item"
                      div class="item"
                        p class="sub-item"
                      div class="item"

                    <p><strong>Grid Line</strong> - The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid.
                    They can be either vertical (column grid lines) or horizontal (row grid lines), and reside on either side of a row or column.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Grid Track</strong> - The space between two adjacent grid lines - i.e. the content in the columns and rows of the grid.</p>
                    <p><strong>Grid Cell</strong> - The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a single "unit" of the grid.</p>
                    <p><strong>Grid Area</strong> - The total space surrounded by four grid lines. It may be comprised of any number of grid cells.

              <h3>Animation Basics</h3>      
              
              -should be snappy <br />
              -durations should be kept short <br />
              -should take advantage of easing <br />
              -you should choose ease-out animations for UI elements (i.e. onclick) <br />
              -avoid ease-in or ease-in-out animations unless you can keep them short - they tend to feel sluggish to end users. <br /><br />
              
              <strong>easing</strong> - an animation that starts slowly and accelerates - it's the process of making an animation less "severe" or pronounced.<br />

              Full guide to animating between views with CSS and JS
              </a>
              
              <h4>Use translations to move between views: </h4>
              
              *Avoid using left, top or any other property that triggers layout (so instead use translate(100%) for example). <br />
              *Assume that there are two views, for example: a list view and a details view. As the user taps a list item inside the list view, the details view slides in, and the list view slides out. <br /><br/>
              
              To achieve this effect you need a <strong>container</strong> for both views that is set to <span class="inline-code">overflow:hidden</span>. <br />
              This way,both views can be inside the container side-by-side without the need for a horizontal scrollbar, and each view can slide side-to-side inside the container as needed. <br /><br />
              
              CSS container:
              <code>
              .container {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
                overflow: hidden;
                position: relative;
              }
              </code>
                                  










            <h2 id="cssDisadvantage">CSS Disadvantages</h2>
              <p>CSS has always been used to do layouts, but using tables, floats, positioning and inline-block are all essentially hacks which left out a lot of important functionality, like vertical centering.</p>

              <h2>Wireframing</h2>      
              <strong>wireframe</strong> - the blueprint of your site <br />
  
              Example Steps:<br />
              1. Draft the design<br />
              2. Organize the content in html<br />
              3. Format in css<br />
              4. Ensure cross-browser compat.<br />
              5. Check validity/testing<br />
              6. Final code<br /><br />
  
              <p>Number of ways different designers go from design to implementation:<br />
              <li>Wireframe -> Interactive Prototype-Visual -> Design</li>
              <li>Sketch -> Code</li>
              <li>Sketch -> Wireframe -> Hi-Def Wireframe -> Visual -> Code</li>
              <li>Sketch -> Wireframe -> Visual -> Code</li></p>

              <h2>UX</h2>

              <h3>UX Principles</h3>

              *Empathy beats intuition - just think about it from the viewpoint of someon clicking around on your site. <br />
              *Knowing the essentials - putting together points, lines and planes in a combination and bring color into the equation. Any UI component can be created.<br />
              *Good design is as little design as possible (aids usability)<br />
              *Optimize legibility <br />
              *Typographic hierarchy (i.e. consistency) <br />
              *Prototype and test with users and then iterate in response <br />
              *Improve accessibility with contrast between foreground and background colors <br />
              *Releasing minimum viable products early and testing them with actual users, moving from alpha to beta to live to adding features <br />
              *According to a UserTesting report, every dollar invested in UX can return between $2 and $100 <br />
              *As a UX designer, your first task in a new job is clearly explaining the value you'll be bringing to the company and how you'll bring that about. <br />
              *Iteration reduces risk <br />
              
              <h3>UX Stages</h3>
              
              1. <strong>Initial stages</strong> <br /><br />
              This is where the research happens. <br />
              A UX designer will generally get a brief from the client or manager asking them to do some project research.<br />
              If ___ wants a new app, the UX designer would combine DESK-BASED and FIELD research to get a full picture of who they're designing for.<br /><br />
              This might include:<br />
              -Reviewing what the current site has to offer.<br />
              -<strong>Interviewing existing users</strong> to identify <strong>opportunities</strong> and <strong>pain points</strong>.<br />
              -<strong>Doing competitor research</strong> to see what else is out there.<br />
              
              <p>
              These tasks will enable the UX designer to <strong>pinpoint the core features needed</strong> for the <strong>minimum viable product</strong> and start <strong>drafting some initial personas</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
              For example, for a food app the core features might be a menu, the ability to make online reservations and a branch finder.
              </p>
              
              2. <strong>Personas and information architecture</strong><br /><br />
              
              With the core features having been decided on, it's time to figure out what <strong>tasks</strong> 
              each persona wants to perform and <strong>why</strong>.
              <br /><br />
              An example persona for a food app might be Lucy, a go-getting 20-something who likes eating artisan salads on her lunch break. <br />
              An example task for her would be: <br />
              "Lucy likes to pre-order the salad via the app on the phone, as it saves her time between meetings."<br />
              <p>
              Once this process has been completed for each persona being considered, then it's possible to REFINE THE CONTENT *NEEDED*, working out the information architecture and SITE MAP and beginning PAPER PROTOTYPES.
              </p>
             
              These are very rough sketches which can be shown to colleagues, and quickly and easily improved.
              <br /><br />
              
              3. <strong>Wireframes and user testing </strong><br /><br />
              After paper prototypes comes WIREFRAMES, USER TESTING, and plenty of ITERATING. <br />
              Wireframes typically go through many stages and there's no right/wrong way of doing them.
              <br /><br />
              
              They often start as very basic b&w designs moving on to interactive designs where users can navigate between the different pages, as they would with the final product, to high-res designs which give the user a really clear idea of what the end product will look like. <br /><br />
              **Each stage is punctuated with user testing and iterations.**
              <br /><br />
              4. <strong>Visual design</strong><br /><br />
              
              During the visual design stage, wireframes are converted into <strong>mock-ups</strong>. <br /><br />
              
              These include the final <strong>imagery</strong>, <strong>color</strong>, and <strong>typography</strong>. <br />
              
              <p>
              The main focus is the <strong>look</strong> and <strong>feel</strong> - they should be <strong>pixel-perfect</strong> and show exactly what the design will look like when brought to life so they can be used as a guide when development starts. <br /><br />
              
              Some UX designers do the visual design themselves using Photoshop etc, but others might choose to use a digital designer/front-end dev to get the design just right.
              </p>

          <section class="main-section" id="Sass">
              <header>Sass/SCSS</header>
              <article>
                  <h2>Sass/SCSS</h2>
                  <h2>.sass vs .scss</h2>
                  <p>
                  When Sass first came out its syntax was noticeably different from CSS - it looked a lot like Haml.
                  In version 3 Sass changed its main syntax to .scss, which is a superset of CSS. You can still use Sass syntax but .scss and its syntax is considered more accessible to those who already know CSS (the terms Sass and SCSS can be seen as essentially interchangeable - SCSS is just "newer Sass" syntax that's made to be more familiar).
                  </p><br />
                  Sass allows you to get more done in less code, more readably, and in less time.
                  
                  <h2>Sass Variables</h2>
                  
                  <p>Variables always start with an $, ex.:</p>
                  <code>
                  $variable-name: variable-value;	
                  </code>
                  
                  <p>Example with HTML:</p>
                  <code>
                  div class="heading"
                    h1 class="heading-primary"This is a primary heading                    
                    h2 class="heading-secondary">This is a secondary heading                
                  </code>
                  
                  <p>Then define two variables for primary and secondary colors:</p>
                  <code>
                  $color-primary: #000;
                  $color-secondary: #fff;
                  </code>
                  
                  <p>Then style the above headings:</p>
                  
                  <code>
                  .heading-primary{
                    color: $color-primary;
                    text-align: center;
                  }
                  
                  .heading-secondary{
                    color: $color-secondary;
                    text-align: center;
                    margin-top: 15px;
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  <p>After compilation, the variables are replaced by their actual values in CSS.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Nesting CSS</h2>
                  
                  <p>CSS doesn't support selector nesting. With Sass, you can nest child selectors inside the parent selector.
                  <br /><br />
                  Instead of having to write:</p>
                  
                  <code>
                  .navigation{
                  background-color: yellow;
                  padding: 10px;
                  }
                  
                  .navigation ul {
                    list-style: none;
                  }
                  
                  .navigation li {
                    text-align: center;
                    margin-top: 10px;
                  } 
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  With the above, you're having to repeat the <span class="inline-code">navigation</span> class name every time you want to style its children. Instead use nested selectors:</p>
                  
                  <code>
                  .navigation{
                    background-color: yellow;
                    padding: 20px;
                  
                    ul{
                      list-style: none;
                    }
                  
                    li{
                    text-align: center;
                    margin-top: 20px;
                    }
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  <h2>Mixins</h2>
                  <p>
                  Mixin syntax:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                  @mixin mixin_name(){
                    //
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  
                  <p>A <strong>mixin</strong> is a reusable piece of code similar to a function. It allows you to make <strong>groups</strong> of CSS declarations to be reused throughout the site.</p>
                  <p>You can also pass in values to make mixins more flexible. <br /><br />
                  An example of a mixin is for vendor prefixes:</p>
                  
                  <code>
                  @mixin transform($property){
                    -webkit-transform: $property;
                    -ms-transform: $property;
                    transform: $property;
                  }
                  
                  .box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); };
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  1. Create a mixin using the @mixin <strong>directive</strong> and give it a name. In the above, it's named transform.
                  2. The variable <span class="inline-code">$property</span>  inside the parantheses is used to pass in a transform of whatever we want.
                  3. You can then use the mixin as a CSS declaration starting with <span class="inline-code">@include</span> followed by the name of the mixin. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  So the above compiles down to:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                  .box {
                    -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
                    -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
                    transform: rotate(30deg);
                  }
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  Another mixin example:
                  </p>
                  
                  <code>
                  @mixin absCenter(){
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 50%;
                    left: 50%;
                    tranform: translate(50%, -50%);
                  }
                  
                  .box{
                    background-color: red;
                  
                    div{
                      width: 200px;
                      height: 200px;
                      background-color: blue;
                      @include absCenter;/*this works even on nested elements: the div now has:
                      position: absolute;
                      top: 50%;
                      left: 50%;
                      transform: translate(50%, -50%);
                    }
                  </code>
                  
                  <p>
                  You can also pass arguments to the mixins:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                  @mixin box-shadow-vendor($x, $y, $blur, $spread){
                    -webkit-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $spread;
                    -moz-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $spread;
                    -mos-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $spread;
                    -box-shadow: $x $y $blur $spread;
                  }
                  
                  .box{
                    background-color: red;
                  
                    div{
                    @include absCenter;
                    @include box-shadow-vendor(0, 5px, 5px, #fff);
                    }
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  <h2>Functions in Sass</h2>
                  <p>
                  Sass has mixins as well as functions. Sass functions are similar to JS functions.</p>
                  <p>
                  They can accept arguments and return a value.</p>
                  Ex.:
                  
                  <code>
                  @function divide($a, $b){
                    @return $a / $b;
                  }
                  
                  @function multiply($a,b){
                    @return $a * $b;
                  }
                  
                  div{
                  height: multiply((divide(60, 2)), 1px);
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  <h2>Partials and Import</h2>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Partials</strong> in Sass are separate files containing Sass code that make the code modular. It allows to have separate Sass files for different components.
                  <br /><br />
                  For example, building a more elaborate math library for Sass off of the example above could be separated out.
                  <br /><br />
                  A partial's name always starts with an underscore. Use @import to import a partial into another Sass file. For example, importing the _header.scss file into main.scss:
                  </p>
                  
                  <code>
                  // main.scss
                  @import 'header'; /*the partial being imported doesn't need to use the _ or .scss when importing */
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  *Unlike CSS imports, Sass imports don't send another HTTP request for fetching the partial since <strong>all the imports are placed into a single CSS file during compilation.</strong>
                  </p>
                  
                  *<h2>
                  Inheritance/Extend</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                  You can share CSS properties from one selector to another using the <span class="code-inline>@extend</span> directive. <br /><br />
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                  
                  Generally, for inheritance you use <strong>placeholder classes</strong> which starts with a <span class="inline-code">%</span>. Using placeholder classes allow you to only print something in the compiled CSS once it's extended. <br /><br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  *<strong>Placeholder selector (%)</strong> - similar to the class selector in CSS, which uses <span class="inline-code">.</span>, but have the additional property that <strong>they will not show up in the generated CSS; only the selectors that extend them will be included in the output.</strong>
                  <br /><br />
                  This helps keep CSS very DRY.
                  <br /><br />
                  
                  In the following:</p>
                  <code>
                  %message-shared{
                    border: 1px solid #ccc;
                    padding: 10px;
                    color: #333;
                  }
                  
                  %equal-heights{
                    display: flex;
                    flex-wrap: wrap;
                    //this will never print because @equal-heights never ends up being extended
                  }
                  
                  .message{
                    @extend %message-shared;
                  }
                  
                  .success{
                    @extend %message-shared;
                    border-color: green;
                  }
                  
                  .error{
                    @extend %message-shared;
                    border-color: red;
                  }
                  
                  .warning{
                    @extend %message-shared;
                    border-color: yellow;
                  }
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  The above code tells .message, .success, .error, and .warning to behave just like <span class="inline-code">%message-shared </span>. <br />
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                  So anywhere <span class="inline-code">%message-shared</span> shows up, .message, .success, .error & .warning will too. <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The magic then happens in the compiled CSS, where each class gets the same CSS properties as <span class="inline-code">%message-shared</span>. <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  This helps you to <strong>avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements</strong>.

                  <p>
                  Instead of doing this:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                  .btn{
                    display: block;
                    padding: 5px 8px;
                  }
                  
                  .btn—green{
                    background-color: green;
                  }
                  
                  .btn: hover{

                  }
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  It can instead be written as:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                  .btn{
                    display: inline-block;
                    padding 5px 8px;
                  
                    &—green{
                    background-color: green;
                    }
                  
                    &:hover{
                    background-color: transparent
                    }
                  }
                  </code>
                  <p>
                  This allows you to nest selectors that share the same name, and during compile-time the & operator is replaced by the enclosing selector name.

                <h2 id="jsCallback">Callback Functions:</h2>
                <b>Callback</b> - A function which is:
                    <li>Passed as an ARGUMENT to another function, and </li>
                    <li>Is invoked after some kind of event (so callback is the child function of a parent almost but not bound to scope) </li>
                    
                  <p>  A callback is a function you provide to another piece of code, allowing it to be called by that code. To "call back" means to pass a function to other function or other 			  code. So it's passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the "outer function" to complete something. And once a callback function's parent function completes, the function passed as an argument is then called.</p>
                  <p> Callback functions are also called higher-order functions.</p>
                    
                    
                  Example of a callback:
                  <code>
                    XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange = callback;
                  </code>
                    This is just a function passed almost like the parameters for another function, that is then also called when that "parent function" is triggered. So you run the parent one and it calls back whatever then gets filled in.
                    
                    <h2 id="jsClosure">Closures:</h2>

                    <p>Closure - Any function where you are using a variable(parameter) outside the scope. </p>

                    <p><b>Closures</b> are important because: <br />
                    1. A scope is at the function level, not the block level<br />
                    2. Much of what you do in hs is async / event-driven<br />
                    3. They make event-driven code a lot easier to write
                    <p>
                    A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables and parameters.
                    The inner function then has access to the outer function's variables and parameters.
                    Even after the outer function has returned, the inner function still has access to the outer function's variables.
                    So, you can call the inner function later in your program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A closure is a function that returns a function - so it's the whole thing and not just the inner function being the closure.
                    The function that is returned (the inner function) is created inside the called function (the outer).
                    Due to the scoping rules we’ve seen, the inner has access to the variables and arguments of the outer. <br /><br />
                    Functions created in a particular scope retain access to vars in the scope even if they are called outside of it, because there's 1. create and 2. call with functions.<br /><br />
                    Example of a closure:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                    function one(a, b){
                      function two(){
                      return "foo";
                      }
                      var variable;
                      return variable;
                    }
                    two();
                    </code>
                    <p>
                    So, even though two is called outside of the function one because it's created inside of one, it has access to one's scope.<br />
                    two() can access one's params (a and b), and var variable / the return statement since it's in one's body and therefore scope.
                    </p>

                    <p>Closures are possible because Javascript uses lexical scoping.</p>

                    <strong>Lexical scope</strong> - The outer scope of a function which is defined inside a closure.<br /><br />

                    Example of a closure:

                    <code>
                        var passed = 3;
                        var addTo = function(){
                          var inner = 2;
                          return passed + inner; 
                        }; /* This is a closure - var passed is available inside the function, 
                        but var inner is not available outside the function */</code>

                    <p>JS in different browsers:</p>
                    <p>This originates in the 90s when there were IE and Netscape - Netscape had JS and IE had Jscript and VBScript
                    Things like jQuery were created to abstract away differences in brower implementations</p>

                    <h2 id="jsCurry">Currying:</h2>

                    <p>
                    <b>Currying </b>provides a way for working with functions that take multiple arguments, and using them in frameworks where functions might take only one argument.
                    An example would be situations where some analytical techniques can only be applied to functions with a single argument.
                    In theoretical work it provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in a simpler theoretical model that provides only one argument.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currying can equal returning a bunch of things or also like how php template tags let you "repeat" things easier than with html across pages.</p>
                    
                    <strong>Currying - </strong> transforming a function that takes multiple parameters, into the same function with less parameters. <br /><br />

                    This "curried effect" is achieved by binding some of the args to the first function invoke, so those values are fixed for the next invocation.
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    Translating a function that takes multiple arguments, into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.<br /><br />
                    
                    Currying is like prefilling certain parts of a function for code reuse - useful in event handling. <br /><br />
                    
                    Currying is a pattern that's not native to js, so you can write a currier that can transform any given function to a curried version of itself:
                    <code>
                    var currier = function(a){
                      var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
                      return function(){
                        return fn.apply(this, args.concat(
                          Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)));
                      };
                    };
                
                    </code>
                    <br />
                    Curried function example:
                    <code>
                    var babyAnimals = function(a){
                      return function(b){
                        var result = 'i love '.concat(a).concat(' and ').concat(b);
                        return result;
                      }

                    <h2 id="jsFeature">Feature Detection:</h2>

                    <p><b>Feature detection</b> - Working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code dependent on whether it does or doesn't so a browser can always provide a working experience rather than crashing/erroring in some browsers.<br />
                    
                    An example would be testing flexbox support in a browser. <br />
                                            
                    Modernizr is the industry standard for feature detection tests. Feature detection is made easy in CSS with the @supports @ rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Do not confuse feature detection with <b>browser sniffing</b>: <br /><br />
                    feature detection = good<br />
                    browser sniffing = bad<br /><br />
                    
                    Browser sniffing is bad because it's an error prone process - the only real use is fixing a bug for a very specific version of a particular browser.
                    </p>
                    
                    Example of feature detection:
                    <code>
                    if("geolocation" in navigator){
                      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(etc…)
                      //show location on a map
                    } else{

                  Technically you could have an if/else statement referencing “action” and define “var action” after them.<br />

            An image map = clickable areas. You can also define coordinates.

            <h2 id="jsMethods">Methods:</h2>

            List of JS methods:



            <h2 id="jsNull">Null vs. Undefined vs. NaN:</h2>
            <p>
            Null = Can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. <br />
            Undefined = A variable that has not been assigned a value. <br /> <br />

            typeof null = object<br />

            typeof undefined = it's already a type - undefined<br /><br />

            So, undefined is a type itself, while null is an object you can interact with ("empty").<br />
            So null can be some empty placeholder thing, ex.: </p>

            <code>

            null + 3
            = 3

            </code>
            <br />
            Whereas with undefined:
            <code>
            undefined + 3
            = undefined or NaN
            </code>
            <p>
            If arithmetic makes no sense, JS yields special Numbers:</p>
            <code>
            Infinity or NaN(Not a Number).
            console.log(5 / 0);
            //->Infinity
            </code>


            <h2 id="jsPropVs">Properties vs. Methods:</h2>

            <li>Data is represented as PROPERTIES of the object, and
            <li>Behavior is represented as the methods</li>

            <p>
            Method: <br />
            In OOP, it's a procedure associated with a. A message (almost like an HTTP header) and b. an Object.
            </p>
            <p>
            That's what an object is and that's what object oriented is: everything including DOM elements has their a. properties (if available) and b. methods (if available). So all the object.thing1.thing2 can be applied to everything.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ex.: A Window object would have methods such as open and close. <br /> 
            That's what it means by procedural is the method is a procedure to be carried out as a message to the object to enact something, while its state is a property.
            </p>
            <p>
            Open and close i.e. procedures i.e. imperatives are methods or things you can perform on/with the object.
            State or value in an array or key-value pair or even like location are properties.
            </p><p>
            Methods are like miniature algorithms, while properties are characteristics.
            Methods allow you to interact with the properties of an object.
            This is also what people mean when they say encapsulation.
            </p><p>
            Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
            The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
            </p>


            <h2 id="jsPrototype">Prototypes:</h2>
            <p>
            Javascript is multi-paradigm:  <br />
            1. OOP with prototypal inheritance <br />
            2. Functional programming <br />
            3. Imperative/procedural programming <br />
            </p>
            <p>
            Every JS object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object. All JS objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype. The prototype pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects, it returns objects that are initialized w the values copied from the prototype object.
            </p>

            So there's: <br /><br />

            1. The prototype (sample)<br />
            2. The clone<br />
            3. The creation of that clone<br /><br />
            Ex.: <br />
            1. function CustomerPrototype(proto){} - //the prototype <br />
            2. function Customer(first, last, something){} - //The cloned objects being created <br />
            3. function run(){} - //creates new object by asking prototype to clone itself <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <li>Objects created with new Object() inherit from a prototype called Object.prototype.</li>
            <li>Object.protoype is at the top of the chain - so all objects inherit from this.</li>
            <li>When you ask for a property of an object, JS looks for that property - if it doesnt find it, it follows the prototype chain until it finds the property, or returns undefined.</li><br />

              <h3>Prototype Example</h3>
              <code>

                  var prototypeof = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
                  var objwithprototype = Object.create(prototypeof);
                  
                  Object.getPrototypeOf(objwithprototype);
                  
                  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(objwithprototype));
                  console.log(prototypeof.isPrototypeOf(objwithprototype));
                  
                  var test= [];
                  Object.assign(test, prototypeof);
                  console.log(test);
                  console.log(Object.entries(test));
                  
                  console.log(typeof test);</code>
                <br />
            <h3>Terms:</h3>

            <b>new</b> keyword - 
            new constructor[(arguments)]<br />
            <b>constructor</b> - Special method for creating an object within a class.<br /><br />
            So JS DOES have classes but they were only introduced in ECMA 2015 ( so constructors are kind of new with JS)<br />
            class-based - constructors & factory method pattern.<br /><br />
            <strong>prototypal</strong> - prototype design pattern. Each instance of an object created from the prototype is just a copy.<br />

            <h2 id="jsPrototypalVs">Prototypal vs. Classical:</h2>

            <b>Classical inheritance</b> - Aka class inheritance "instances" inherit from classes, like a blueprint (PHP). <br />
            These are usually instantiated via constructor functions using the new keyword. (PHP) <br />
            Class inheritance may or may not use the "class" keyword. <br /><br />

            <b>Prototypal inheritance</b> - Aka "instances" inherit directly from other objects aka "prototypes".<br />
            They're usually instantiated via "factory functions" or ex. object.create().<br />
            Prototypal inheritance is simpler and more flexible than class inheritance.<br />
            Prototypal inheritance = objects WITHOUT CLASSES, OLOO. <br />

            <h2 id="jsPure">Pure Functions</h2>

            A function where the return value is only determined by its input values w/o side-effects. <br />
            Ex.: math.cos(x). Computing this does not change "x" - doesn't ask for input or change state. <br />
            So pure = stateless for the most part.

            <h2 id="jsRecursion">Recursion</h2>
              <p>
              <b>Recursion</b> - A function invoking (calling) itself again and again until it reaches the final return condition at which point it returns the final value.<br /><br />
              Each time the function is called, a new local scope is created.
              
              </p>



              <h2 id="jsReturn">Return Statements</h2>
              <p>
              <b>Return</b> - a and b are a function’s parameters, and the value it returns is signified by the return keyword. 
              <li>The return keyword also stops execution of the code in the function; nothing after it will be run.</li>
              <li>Functions without a return, aka “returning nothing”, will end up being “undefined”. Every function is going to return “Undefined” UNLESS you give it a return value. </li>
              <li>A function's return value can be passed to another function as a parameter.</li>
              </p>
              


            <h2 id="jsSelectors">Selectors:</h2> 

            Use a <b>selector</b> to grab an element, ex.:
            <code>
            var numOne = document.getElementById(“num-one”);</code>

            <h2 id="jsSide">Side Effects:</h2>
            <p>
            <b>side-effects</b> - Any app state change that is observable (aka opposite of pure functions). Side effects are avoided in functional programming. <br /> <br />
            Ex.: Writing to a file, triggering any external process, logging to the console.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>State</b> - Information about something held in memory. The set values that something's attributes have at any given moment (things saved to memory).<br /><br />
            Ex.: 10, or "HELLO"= By itself is stateless - does not represent any state. (aka pure values)
            <br />
            There's a state when these "pure values" are associated to some kind of entities, for ex. objects. <br /><br />
            Ex.:<br />
            <code>var car = ("color", "blue"); //properties of "car"
            </code>
            <br /> Since car has properties it has a state.
            It's associated to an "entity" (i.e. class/object I think), but ALSO to a point in time.
            So if today car = color, blue but tomorrow it's color, black, then black is the new state of that car object.<br /><br />Properties = states.<br />
            When the properties change, the states change.<br /><br />


            <b>Shared state</b> - aka shared mutability. Can be bad because code isn't like containerized or separated or whatever, so it can be a mess.

            </p>


            <h2 id="jsThis">this Operator:</h2>

            Ex.:<br /><br />

            "John is running fast because <b>he</b> is trying to catch the train".<br /><br />

            The this operator acts like the pronoun "he" - so we don't have to say "John is running fast because John is trying to catch the train".
            <br /><br />

            Ex.:

            <code>
            var person = {
              firstName: "Bob",
              lastName: "Logg",
              function fullName(){
              console.log(this.firstName + this.lastName);
              console.log(person.firstName + person.Lastname);
              }
            }</code>

            In this instance, this.firstName is the same as saying person.FirstName, so it just lets you	reference it without being redundant.

            This is used because there could be a global var w the same name as the one you're interacting with (ex. global person and var person).
            <br /><br />
            Ex.:
            <code>
            $("button").click(function (event){
              console.log($ (this).prop ("name"));
            this will have a val of ($("button"))
            });</code>

            So this can be used in syntax where you need to access an function's props within the function itself ex.:
            <code>
            function showFullName(){
              console.log(this.firstName + this.LastName);
            }</code>


            <h2 id="jsTypes">Types</h2>

            <h3>There are 7 total data types:</h3>

            Primitive types: <br />
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Null</li>
            <li>Undefined</li>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Symbol(new in ES6)</li>
            <br />

            Non-primitive types: <br />
            <li>Object</li><br />

            All types except the non-primitive type, object, define immutable values, incapable of being changed.
            <br /><br />
            Function = primitive type<br />
            Object = complex type<br /><br />

            Every "thing" in JS - including primitive data types and other things - Ex.: <br /> 
            <li>Date Object</li>
            <li>String Object</li>
            <li>Number Object</li>
            <li>Math Object</li>
            <li>Array Object</li>
            <li>Boolean Object</li>
            <li>Error Object</li>
            <li>RegExp Object</li>
            <br />
            These are all OBJECTS - as in they have specific PROPERTIES and then METHODS. So Math is an object as well.
            <br />
            <h3>Terms:</h3>

            <b>Polymorphism</b> - A type whose operations can be applied to values of some other type or types. (ex. int and variables) <br /><br />

            <b>Subtypes</b> - Ex. cat is a subtype of animal. So, an expression of type cat can be used anywhere that type animal is used. <br /><br />

            <b>Type Theory</b> - When with math they write f: X —> Y, X is the old type, Y is the new type being built from the old, and the arrod is a type constructor that i guess designates this.

            <h2 id="jsVoid">Void Operator </h2>

              <strong>Void</strong>: 
              
              <li>Is an operator that's used to return an undefined value so the browser will not be able to load a new page.</li>
              
              <li>Is used in an immediately-invoked function expression</li>
              
              <li>Can be used to force the function keyword to be treated as an expression instead of a declaration</li>

            <h2 id="js2String">Strings</h2>
            <h3>String Methods</h3>
              
              *Methods and properties are accessed the same way, ex.: <br />
              str.indexOf() is a method, str.length is a property. <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">charAt()</span> - returns character at specified position of string, ex.: 
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World";
              var strResult = str.charAt(3);
              </code><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">concat()</span> - join two or more strings. Ex.:
              <code>
              var str1 = "Hello ";
              var str2 = "world,";
              var str3 = " have a nice day";
              var result = str1.concat(str2, str3);
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">endsWith()</span> - checks if a string ends with the characters of a specified string, ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
              var strCheck = str.endsWith("universe.");
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">includes()</span> - check if a string includes specified characters, ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World, welcome to the universe.";
              var strResult = str.includes("welcome);
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">indexOf()</span> - returns the position of the first occurence of a specified value in a string. Returns <span class="inline-code">-1</span> if the value to search never occurs. <br />
              Ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World, welcome to the universe.";
              var strResult = str.indexOf( "welcome"); //returns 13
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">lastIndexOf()</span> - returns the position of the last occurence of a specified value in a string.
              
              <span class="inline-code">match()</span> - searches a string for a match against a regex; returns the match(es) as an <strong>Array</strong> object. Ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain";
              var res = str.match(/ain/g);
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">repeat()</span> - returns a new string with <strong>a specified number of copies</strong> of the string it's called on, ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World";
              str.repeat(2);
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">replace()</span> - a. searches a string for a specified value or regex, and b. returns a new string where the values are replaced. 
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World";
              var strNew = strReplace("World", "Universe"); //specify word to be replaced
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">search()</span> - searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match. <br /><br />
              
              <strong><span class="inline-code">slice()</span></strong> - extracts part of a string, returns the extracted part in a new string. <br />
              Use the start and end parameters to specify the part of the string to extract. <br />
              Syntax: <span class="inline-code">string.slice(start, end)</span> <br /><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">split()</span> - split a <strong>string</strong> into <strong>an array of substrings</strong>, then returns the new array.
              <br />
              *If an empty string ("") is used as the separator, the string is split between each character. <br />
              Ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "How are you today?";
              str.split(" "); //returns How,are,you,doing,today?
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">startsWith()</span> - determines whether a string begins with the characters of a specified string; returns a boolean. Ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World";
              var strStart = str.startsWith("Hello");
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">substr()</span> - literally the same as slice().<br /><br />
              <span class="inline-code">substring()</span> - literally the same as slice(). <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">toLowerCase()</span> - converts a string to lowercase letters. <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">toString()</span> - returns the value of a string object. Ex.:
              <code>
              var str = "Hello World";
              var result = str.toString(); //returns Hello World
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">toUpperCase()</span> - converts a string to uppercase letters. <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">trim()</span> - removes whitespace from both sides of a string. <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">valueOf()</span> - returns the primitive value of a String object (not typically used). <br /><br />
              
              
            <h3>String Properties</h3>
              
              <span class="inline-code">constructor</span> property - returns a reference to the function that created the instance object. <br /><br />	
              
              <span class="inline-code">length</span> property - returns length of a string in a number of characters.
              <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">Prototype</span> property - use to add a new property to all objects of a given type (add new properties and methods to existing object types, like "employee"), ex.:
              <code>
              function employee(name, jobtitle, born) {
                this.name = name;
                this.jobtitle = jobtitle;
              }
              employee.prototype.salary = 2000l
              </code><br />

            <h2 id="js2Array">Arrays</h2>
            <h3>Array Methods</h3>
            
              <span class="inline-code">concat()</span> - join two or more arrays.<br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">copyWithin()</span> - copy the first two array elements, and replace the last two array elements with them.<br /><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">entries()</span> - create an <strong>Array Iterator</strong> object with key-value pairs for each item. Ex.:
              
              <code>

              fruit.entries();
              /*prints out:
              [0, "Banana"]
              [1, "Orange"]
              [2, "Apple"]

                return age >= 18;
              };
              ages.every(checkAdult);

              </code><br />
              
              <strong><span class="inline-code">filter()</span></strong> creates an array of all the elements matching the condition in the callback. so if a condition is true for a value being filtered, it gets put in the array. Ex.:
              <code>
              const isBigEnough = (element) {
                return element >= 10;
              }//the callback function with the condition to be tested
              var filtered = [12, 5, 9, 130, 44].filter(isBigEnough);
              
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">find()</span> - returns the value of the first element in an array that passes a given test (callback) Ex.:
              <code>
              var ages = [3, 10, 18, 20];
              
              var checkAdult = (age)  => {
                return age >= 18;
              };
              ages.find(checkAdult);
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">findIndex()</span> - almost the same as find(), but returns the index of that first value that passes the test instead of returning the actual value itself.<br /><br />
              
              
              *<span class="inline-code">forEach()</span> - calls a provided function once for each element in an array, in order (not unlike for loop).<br /><br />
              
              
              **<span class="inline-code">from()</span> converts either a. any object with a length property, or b. an iterable object into an Array (ex. a string). Example:
              <code>
              var myArr = Array.from(""ABCDEFG);
              //returns array ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]

              Syntax: <span class="inline-code">array.indexOf(item, start)</span> 
              <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">isArray()</span> - check whether an object is an array. Syntax: <span class="inline-code">Array.isArray(obj)</span> 
              <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">join()</span> - joins the elements of an array <strong>into a string</strong>, and returns the string. <br />
              The elements will be seaparated by a specified separator (optional); the default separator is a comma. Syntax: <span class="inline-code">array.join(separator)</span> <br />
              Ex.:
              <code>
              var fruits = ["Bananas", "Oranges", "Apples"];
              var combine = fruits.join();
              //outputs Bananas,Oranges,Apples - comma is separator by default
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">keys()</span> -returns an array of a given object's <strong>property names</strong>, in the same order you'd get with a normal loop, ex.:
              <code>
              const object1 = {
                a: 'string',
                b: 42,
                c: false
              };//so it returns an object's keys, in order
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">lastIndexOf()</span> - searches array for specified item, returns its position.
              <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">map()</span> creates an output array after calling a function for every input array element. Ex.:
              <code>
              var numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25];
              const myFunction = () => {
                numbers.map[Math.sqrt];
              };
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">pop()</span> - removes the last element off the end of an array and returns that element. (pops off the end)
              <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">push()</span> - adds specified element(s) to the <strong>end</strong> of an array; returns new array length. (pushes into the end)<br /><br />
              
              
              *<span class="inline-code">reduce()</span> - reduces given array to a single value; it executes a provided function for each value of the array, from left to right. <br />
              The return of that function is stored in an <strong>accumulator</strong>. Ex.:
              <code>
              var numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4];
              
              function getSum(total, num) {
                return total + num;
              }
              
              function myFunction(item) {
                numbers.reduce(getSum);
              }
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">reduceRight()</span> - same as reduce() but operates right-to-left on an array instead of left-to-right.<br /><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">reverse()</span> - reverses order of items in an array.<br /><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">shift()</span> - removes the first item off the beginning of an array (shifts array "backward" - removes first item)<br /><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">slice()</span> - returns selected elements of an array <strong>as a new array object</strong>. Syntax: <span class="inline-code">array.slice(start, end)</span>. slice() does not include the last given element.<br /><br />
              
              
              <span class="inline-code">some()</span> - checks if any elements in an array pass a test, provided as a function - returns a boolean. Ex.:
              <code>
              var ages = [3, 10, 18, 20];
              
              function checkAdult(age){
                return age >= 18;
              }
              
              function myFunction(){
                ages.some(checkAdult);
              }
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">sort()</span> - sorts items of an array - can be alphabetic, numeric, ascending (up) or sescending (down). <br />
              By default, sort() sorts the values <strong>as strings</strong> in alphabetical, ascending order.
              <br />
              The sort() method provides incorrect results when sorting numbers if doing so by default - so provide a <strong>compare function</strong>. Ex.:
              <code>
              var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
              points.sort(function(a, b){return a-b}); //compare function used with sort - ascending order
              
              points.sort(function(a, b){return b-a}); //descending order
              </code><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">splice()</span> - adds or removes items to or from an array.<br /><br />
              Removing elements - give the <strong>index</strong> parameter, and <strong>number of elements to be removed</strong>: <span class="inline-code">array.splice(index, number of elements);</span> <br />
              If no second parameter is given, every element starting from the given index (as parameter a) will be removed from the array.
              <br /><br />
              Adding elements - these are specified as the 3rd, 4th, and 5th parameter (depending on how many are being added): <span class="inline-code">array.splice(index, number of elements, element, element…);</span> 
              Example that adds a and be to the beginning of an array while removing nothing:
              <code>
              array.splice(0, 0, 'a', 'b');
              </code><br />
              
              *Adding elements with splice() requires extra parameters/syntax.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="inline-code">toString()</span> - converts array to a string.
              <br /><br />
              
              <span class="inline-code">unshift()</span> - <strong>adds</strong> new items to the <strong>beginning</strong> of an array; returns new length (so shift "shifts front of array" after removing first element, this "unshifts" it by adding one instead).
              
              <span class="inline-code">valueOf()</span> - returns an array (a.k.a. the value of the array). Ex.:
              <code>
              var a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
              if (valueOf(a) != 1, 2, 3, 4) {
                //run something
              }
              </code><br />
            
            <h3>Array Properties</h3>            
              <span class="inline-code">constructor</span> - returns an array's constructor function.
              <br /><br />              
              <span class="inline-code">length</span> - sets or returns the number of elements in an array.
              <br /><br />              
              <span class="inline-code">prototype</span> - constructor that that allows you to <strong>add new properties and methods</strong> to the Array() object. <br />
              So, when constructing a property, <strong>ALL arrays are given the property</strong>, and its value, as default. <br />
              When constructing a method, ALL arrays have this method available. <br />
              *So Array.prototype doesn't refer to a single array but <strong>to the Array() object itself</strong>.

                <h2>jQuery Method Examples:</h2>
                <li>.addClass()</li>
                <li>.removeClass()</li>
                <li>.ready (i.e.docready)</li>
                <li>.css()</li>
                <li>.prop() - allows you to adjust the properties of elements.</li>
                <li>.html() - lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.</li>
                <li>.remove()</li>
                <li>appendTo() - allows you to select html elements and append them to other elements, ex:</li>
                
                <code>
                $("#target4").appendTo("#right-well")
                </code>
                
                <li>clone() - makes a copy of an element,ex.:</li>
                <code>
                $("#target5").clone().appendTo("#left-well");
                </code>
                <li>children() - Allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.</li>
                <li>parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected. Ex: </li>
                <code>
                $("#target1").parent().css("background-color", "red");  
                </code>
                
                Methods can be nested one in another this way to perform multiple actions in order.                    
                
                <h2>Targeting With jQuery</h2>
                
                When we start using jQuery, we will modify HTML elements without needing to actually change them in HTML, ex: <br />
              
                
                <code>
              
                  $(document).ready(function() {
                    $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
                  });
              
                </code>
                <p>
                This makes all button elements bounce. They're selected with $("button"), then we added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");
                </p>
                There are three ways of targeting elements: 
                <li>by type: $("button")</li>
                <li>by class: $(".btn")</li>
                <li>by id $("#target1").</li>
                
                _
                
                <h2>Target the Parent of an Element Using jQuery</h2>
                
                For example, your jQuery Playground h3 element has the parent element of <div class="container-fluid">, which itself has the parent body.
                
                jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected.
                
                Here's an example of how you would use the parent() function if you wanted to give the parent element of the left-well element a background color of blue:
                <code>
                $("#left-well").parent().css("background-color", "blue")
                </code>
                
                <h2>Target a Specific Child of an Element Using jQuery</h2>
                
                <p>jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(n) css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.</p>
                
                Ex. Give the third element in each well the bounce class:
                <code>
                $(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");
                </code>

          <section class="main-section" id="OOP">
            <header>OOP</header>
            <article>

            <h2>OOP is all about:</h2>
            <li>An Object</li> 
            <li>Its Properties (Ex. State)</li> 
            <li>Its Methods (Ex. Sort)</li> 

            <p>Code is organized into objects.
              You can use dot OR bracket notation to access the properties of an object. <br />
              A JavaScript object is, in that sense, a collection of named properties and methods - a function. 
              An object can be stored in a variable, and the properties and methods accessed using the dot syntax.
            </p>

            <h2>Object literal syntax:</h2>
            1. A colon separates a prop name from a val<br />
            2. A comma separates each name-val pair<br />
            3. There should be no comma after the last name-val pair<br /><br />

            Ex:
            <code>
            var myObject = {
              tempProp: 'some string value',
              assPropr: 2,
              boolProp: true
            }; 
            </code>

            <h2>Class vs Object:</h2>

            <p><strong>Class > Object</strong></p>
        
            <p><strong>Class </strong>- A program-code-template for creating OBJECTS. <br /><br />
            A class provides: <br /></p>
            <li>Initial VALS for the STATE(member variables)</li>
            <li>Implementations of behavior (member functions/methods)</li>
            <p>
            When an object is created using a constructor, the resulting object is called an instance of the class.
            So when you use a class as a kind of object builder, and make some objects, those new objects created from the class are called instances.</p>
              <p>
            <strong>Classical</strong> = class-based = defining CLASSES of OBJECTS, as opposed to the OBJECTS THEMSELVES.<br />
            This does contrast with prototypal because in prototypal, <strong>an object's prototype it's created from is itself an object and not a class.</strong><br /><br />
            The structure and behavior of an object in class-based is defined by the class, read blueprint, of all objects of a specific type (aka class).</p>
            

            <h2>Terms</h2>

                <strong>Lodash</strong> - provides a massive library of "utility" functions (like loop for N times), using <strong>functional programming</strong>. <br /><br />

                It's largely based off Underscore.js, including syntax (_.method). (Low-dash)
                <br /><br />

                Ex.:
                <code>
                // Fetch the name of the first pet from each owner
                var ownerArr = [{
                "owner": "Colin",
                "pets": [{"name":"dog1"}, {"name": "dog2"}]
                }, {
                "owner": "John",
                "pets": [{"name":"dog3"}, {"name": "dog4"}]
                }];

                // Array's map method.
                ownerArr.map(function(owner){
                return owner.pets[0].name;
                });

                // Lodash
                _.map(ownerArr, 'pets[0].name');
                </code>

                Lodash <strong>map</strong> method - works exactly like the JS map method, but it's able to navigate deeply-nested properties by simply providing a string instead of a callback function. <br /><br />

                <h3>Tips</h3>               
                  
                  *React is best for large programs that display a lot of changing data. <br />
                  *If a JS file containes JSX then it will have to be compiled. <br />
                
                <h3>Redux</h3>            
                <h4>Actions</h4>
                  
                  <strong>Actions</strong> are <strong>payloads</strong> of information that send data from your application to your <strong>store</strong>.
                  <br /><br />
                  Actions are the only source of information for the store. You send actions to the store using <span class="inline-code">store.dispatch()</span>. <br />
                  
                  Example of an action that represents adding a new todo item:
                  
                  <code>
                  const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'	//type defined as string constant
                  
                  {
                    type: ADD_TODO,
                    text: 'Build my first Redux app'
                  
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  <strong>Actions</strong> are plain JS objects. They must have a <span class="inline-code">type</span> property that indicates the type of action being performed (ADD_TODO in the above example). 
                  <br /><br />
                  The only way to change the state (which is read-only) is to emit an action, which is an object describing what happened.
                  <br /><br />
                  
                  <strong>Store</strong> - an object that brings actions and reducers together.
                  
                  The state of your whole application is stored in an <strong>object tree</strong>, within a single store. So, the store is a single state tree.
                  
                <h4>State</h4>
                  In React, you can imagine the app's state being described as a plain JS obeject. For example, the state of a todo app might look like this:
                  
                  <code>
                  {
                    todos: [{
                      text: 'Eat food',
                      completed: false
                    }, {
                      text: 'Exercise',
                      completed: true
                    }],
                    visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
                  }
                  </code>
                  
                  This object is like a "model", except there are no setters. This is so <strong>different parts of the code can't change the state arbitrarily, which can lead to hard-to-reproduce bugs.</strong>
                  <br /><br />
                  To change something in the state you need to dispatch an <strong>action</strong>, which is a <strong>plain Javascript object</strong> that describes what happened. <br />
                  Action examples:
                  
                  <code>
                  { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }
                  { type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }
                  { type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL'}
                  </code>
                  
                  Enforcing that <strong>every change is described as an action</strong> lets you have a clear understanding of what's going on in the app. So if something changes, you know why. Actions are simply like breadcrumbs of what's happened.
                  
                  <br /><br />
                  
                  To <strong>tie state and actions together</strong>, you write a function called a reducer. A reducer is just a function that a.<strong>takes state and action as arguments</strong>, and b.<strong>returns the next state of the app</strong>.
                  <br /><br />
                  It would be hard to write such a function for a larger app, so you write smaller functions managing <strong>parts</strong> of the state.
                  
                <h4>Reducers</h4>
                  
                  In Redux, state is managed by <strong>reducer</strong> functions. In functional programming, reducers like Array.reduce(), for example, <strong>take a collection of inputs and reduce them to a single value</strong>. That single output could be any type. You could count inputs and return a total as an integer.
                  <br /><br />
                  
                  Reducers are just <strong>pure functions that take the previous state of an action and return the next state</strong>. Return new state objects, instead of mutating the previous state.
                  
                  A Redux reducer <strong>takes the current state, and returns the new state</strong>. Because React only re-renders if the object it's given has changed we almost always want to <strong>return a new object</strong> in the Reducer.
                  <br /><br />
                  You can use one reducer for a collection of data, and specify specific actions for a reduce to act on. In Redux these are called <strong>Actions</strong>, while in Vuex they're called <strong>Mutations</strong>. So, 1. <strong>actions mutate state</strong> as they're sent into Redux, 2. which <strong>maps them to the right reducer</strong> and 3. <strong>applies middlewares</strong>.
                  <br /><br />
                  Reducer functions in Redux typically <strong>take an object as the second argument</strong>, which is the action, and <strong>use a switch control structure</strong> on <span class="inline-code">action.type</span>. Example:
                  
                  <code>
                  import {ADD_PROCESSOR} from './actions';
                  
                  /**
                  Reducer for managing a collection of processors
                  State is the collection of processors as a map
                  
                  export const processorsReducer = (state = {})              
                  </code>

              <p><strong>pull request</strong> - A method of submitting contributions to an open development project. A pull "request" occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repo to be considered for inclusion in a project's main repo.</p>
              <p>It's called a pull request because you're requesting the target repo to please "pull" your changes in from your own repo/copy of their repo.</p>

            <p><strong>Continuous integration</strong> - Continuous integration - When Git, Gulp or something similar, and a cloud platform are used to automate the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to watched files (which with Git is usually the entire repo).
            </p>

            <p>
              Committing code triggers an automated build system to grab the latest code from the shared repository and to build, test, and validate the full master branch.

            <h2>Gulp vs. Webpack</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Webpack</strong> - like Gulp. It's a bundle system that takes files like SASS files or JS files with modules and dependencies or images that are connected in some way, and bundles them into standard JS, CSSm PNG and JPG files. This "bundling" is essentially the same as the build process. <br /> <br/>
            </p>
            Webpack does many of the same things as Gulp: <br /> <br/>
            
            -Takes files, runs them through some form of conversion/transpiling <br />
            -Spits out something the browser can understand
            
            <p>
            If you need to do basic bundling, just stick with Gulp. But if mixing in multiple JS files and maybe having some of them split up in certain ways, or if you need to have jQuery and Bootstrap split out but still want to share them between files,or if you need multiple HTML files then look at Webpack.

            <h3 id="sdpLife">Program Lifecycle Phase</h3>
              
              How a program runs - (program lifecycle phase) <br /><br />
              
              1. <strong>Edit</strong> time
              2. <strong>Compile</strong> time
              3. <strong>Link</strong> time - 
              4. <strong>Distribution</strong> time - 
              5. <strong>Installation time</strong>
              6. <strong>Load time</strong>
              7. <strong>Run time</strong>
              
              <h4>Edit time </h4>
              
              This is when the source code of the program is being edited. This spans from initial creation to any a. bug fix, b. refactoring, or c. addition of new features. <br /><br />
              
              Editing is typically performed by a person, but aotmated design tools and metaprogramming systems may also be used. <br />
              
              <h4>Compile time</h4>
              
              When source code is translated "down" (I think) into machine code by a compiler. This partly involves language checking, such as ensuring proper use of the type system. <br /><br />
              
              The result of successful compilation is an executable. 
              
              <h4>Link time</h4>
              
              Connects all necessary machine code components of a program, <strong>including externals</strong> .
              It is very common for programs to use functions implemented by ext libraries, 
              <strong>all of which must properly be linked together.</strong> <br /><br />
              
              There are two types of linking: <strong>static linking</strong>, which is when the connection is made by the compiler. It always occurs prior to execution.
              
              <strong>Dynamic linking</strong>, however, is performed by the operating system just before, or even during execution.
              
              <h4>Distribution time</h4>
              
              When a copy of the program is being transferred to a user.
              This dist format is typically an executable, bit it can also be the source code, especially for a program writtn in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language" target="_blank">interpreted language</a>.
              Distribution can be physical media such as a USB drive, or a remote download via the Internet.
              
              <h4>Installation time</h4>
              
              This gets the distributed program ready for execution on the user's computer, which often includes storing executables for future loading by the operating system.
              
              <h4>Load time</h4> 
              
              When the OS takes the program's executable from storage, such as a hard drive, and <strong>places it into active memory</strong>, in order to begin execution.
              
              <h4>Run time</h4>
              
              This is the execution phase, when the CPU executes the program's <strong>machine code</strong> instructions. Programs may run indefinitely. If execution terminates, it will either be normal and expected behavior, or result in an abnormality such as a crash.
              
              
            <h3 id="sdpFunc">Functional Programming</h3>
              
              Functional programming involves mathematical "functions". <br /><br />            
              Pros: 
              
              <li>Using the functional paradigm. you can avoid shared state/side-effects, eliminating bugs from multiple functions competing for the same resources</li>
              <li>More generally reusable code compared to OOP</li>
              
              Cons: 
              
              <li>Potentially reduce readability</li>
              <li>Not everyone understands functional programming as well as OO/imperative</li>
              <li>OOP = more conversational since it's more popular, functional = more academic and formal </li>
              <br />
              <strong>OOP</strong> - tends to be imperative rather than declarative. <br />
              
              <p>Pros: Somewhat straightforward</p>
              <p>Cons: Typically depends on shared state.</p>
              <h4>Subset and Superset</h4>
              
              
              With A and B, if A is B is a superset of A, then all of A is contained in B (and then extended), so all elements of A are also elements of B, so where B is a superset of A, then  A is a subset of B (the subset is the smaller thing that is contained in another thing).

              dependency hell <br /><br />
            
            <h3 id="sdpMVC">MVC</h3>            
              
              1. The <strong>model</strong> represents the data <br />
              2. The<strong> view</strong> displays the model data (aka UI elements) <br />
              3. The view, when interacted with, sends user actions (i.e. clicks etc) to the <strong>controller</strong>. The controller <strong>evaluates HTML expressions</strong>. <br />
              
              <h4>2-way data binding vs 1-way data flow</h4>
              
              In 2-way binding, UI fields are bound to model data dynamically so the user updates the the UI field and the model changes as well, and vice-versa. <br /><br />
              
              1-way data flow means the model is the single source of truth. <br /><br />
              
              Controller example: <br /><br />
              
              When a call is made to: <br />
              http://example.com/news/latest/10 <br /><br />
              
              We can imagine there's a controller named "news". <br />
              The method being called on news would be "latest". <br />
              That news method's job could be to grab 10 news items, and render them on the page.  <br /> <br />
              
              MVC URL Patterns: <br />
              http://example.com/[controller-<strong>CLASS</strong>]/[controller-<strong>METHOD</strong>]/[<strong>ARGUMENTS</strong> (for method)] <br /><br />
              
              This is typical, although it can change as URL schemes become more complex.
              <br />
            
            <h3 id="sdpMicro">Microservices vs. Monolithic</h3>
            
            
              Microservices are <strong>loosely coupled</strong>, collaborating services (utilizing service-oriented architecture). <br />
              Services communicate using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP/REST/GRAPHQL or async protocols such as AMQP. <br />	
              <strong>Each service has its own database in order to be DECOUPLED from other services.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              
              They're referred to as "micro" services for a reason: the amazon.com website application calls 100-150 services to get the data used to build a web page. <br /><br />
              
              Most large scale websites (Amazon, Netflix etc) have evolved from a monolithic to a microservice architecture. <br /><br />
              
              Example of services:
              An app might have order or customer management "services".
              <br />
              
              <h4>Use cases</h4>
              
              When do you need to use microservices?<br />
              -When you have an app that's scaling and the developers to support it<br />
              -When you need to take advantage of continuous deployment<br /><br />
              
              Microservices are useful when you have an application that may have/need:<br />
              
              <li>Integration with other apps via web services, etc.</li>
              <li>Handle HTTP reqs and msgs by executing business logic</li>
              <li>Access a database</li>
              <li>Exchange msgs w other systems</li>
              <li>Return an HTML/JSON response</li> <br />
              
              Example of when you need to utilize microservices: <br /><br />
              
              1. There's a team of devs working on the app <br />
              2. New members must quickly become productive<br />
                (So I could get assigned something that's tracked in Trello, etc. - integrated with Github - probably slack as the communication)<br />
              3. App <strong>must be easy to understand and modify </strong> (clear documentation)<br />
              4. You want to practice <strong>continuous deployment</strong> of the app <strong>(XP)</strong>
              5. You must run <strong>multiple copies</strong> on <strong>multiple machines</strong> in order to satisfy <strong>scalability</strong> and availability requirements. (cloud)
              6. You want to take advantage of emerging tech (frameworks, langs, etc.)
              7. You need data consistency.
              <br />
              
              <h4>Benefits and Drawbacks of Microservices</h4>
              
              Benefits:
              -Microservices are relatively small <br />
              -IDE is faster making devs more productive <br />
              -App starts faster, speeding up deployments <br />
              -Each service can be deployed independently of other services - escapes dependency hell
              -Scalability <br />
              -Each team can therefore develop, deploy and scale their services independently of all other teams <br />
              -Eliminates any long-term commitment to a tech stack (i.e. vendor lock) <br /> <br />
              
              Drawbacks:
              -Devs must deal with extra complexity of creating a <strong>distributed system</strong> <br />
              -Dev tools / IDE's are usually oriented with building MONOLITHIC apps, and <strong>don't provide explicit support for developing distributed apps </strong> <br />
              -Testing becomes more difficult <br /><br />
              
              How to partition the system into microservices: <br /><br />
              
              -Separating by use case, for example "Shipping Service" is one use so any relevant code can be bundled into that as necessary. Then you might have an "Account Service" that may need different resources from said Shipping Service. <br />
              -Implementing queries that need to retrieve data owned by multiple services (async taken into consideration)<br />

              <a href="images/agile-workflow.png" target="_blank">Agile development workflow graphic</a>

              <strong>AGILE</strong> - Requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing, cross-functional teams.
              <br /> <br />
              -Adaptive planning <br />
              -Evolutionary dev <br />
              -Early delivery <br />

              -Rapid and flexible response to change <br />


            <h3 id="sdpSolid">S O L I D</h3>

              <strong>S</strong>ingle responsibility principle  <br />
              <strong>O</strong>pen/closed principle  <br />
              <strong>L</strong>iskov substitution principle  <br />
              <strong>Interface</strong> segregation principle  <br />
              <strong>D</strong>ependency inversion principle  <br />

              <strong>Single responsibility principle</strong> - <br />
              A CLASS should have only a single responsibility (reduce coupling) <br /><br />

              Open/closed principle -  <br />
              Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification <br /><br />

              Liskov substitution principle -  <br />
              Objects in a program should be replaceable w instances of their subtypes, w/o altering the correctness of that program. <br /><br />

              Interface segregation principle -   <br />
              Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. <br /><br />

              Dependency inversion principle -  <br />
              One should depend on abstractions not concretions (a.k.a. explicit) <br /><br />


            <h3 id="sdpState">States and State Management</h3>
	
              State is a very important consideration when developing SPAs. <br /><br />          
              
              <strong>State management</strong> is the practice of putting all of the dynamic values of an application — user inputs to a form, the current page's posts — in one place.  <br /><br />                           
              Some state is server-based (AJAX, <strong>websockets</strong>), but a lot of state has nothing to do with a server: <span class="inline-code">isPlaying</span>, <span class="inline-code">isTyping</span>, etc.



            <h3 id="sdpService">Service Workers</h3>

              <strong>Service workers</strong> - a fundamental technology in the future web platform. They're scripts that the browser runs in the background, separate from a web page (almost like the web browser version of a daemon). They enable you to access features that don't need a web page or user interaction, like push notifications, background sync and offline experiences.
              <br /><br />
              
              Main aspects: <br />
              
              <li>Life Cycle</li>
              <li>Registration</li>
              <li>High Performance Loading</li>
              <li>HTTPS (required)</li>

            <h3 id="sdpArch">Software Architectures</h3>
              
              <strong>Two-tier architecture</strong> - Software architecture where a <strong>presentation layer</strong> or interface (or view or UI) runs on a <strong>client</strong> (the computer, for example), and a <strong>data layer</strong> or data structure gets stored on a server. <br /><br />
              
              <strong>Three-tier architecture</strong> - <br /><br />
              
              PRESENTATION LAYER 	(client computers) <br />
              BUSINESS LOGIC	          (application server) <br />
              DATABASE		          		(database server) <br />
                  
                  

            <h3 id="sdpFlow">Flow Chart Basics</h3>

              An <strong>oval</strong> shape is used to indicate the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> of the program.
              <br /><br />
              A <strong>parallelogram</strong> is used to indicate <strong>
              input</strong> and <strong>output</strong> operations.
              <br /><br />
              A <strong>rectangle</strong> is used to indicate <strong>operations like assignment, expressions, etc.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              A <strong>diamond</strong> shape indicates a decision operation, i.e. <strong>conditions</strong>.
              A <strong>hexagon</strong> shape indicates <strong>loops, iterations, or repititions</strong>.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Arrows</strong> indicate the direction/flow of execution
              A <strong>circle</strong> is used when a flowchart spreads to more than one page; it's used to indicate connection between them.
            



            <h3 id="sdpDefine">Definitions</h3>
              
              <strong>Modularization</strong> - attempts to be an answer to the JS scalability question. <br />
              However it adds another layer of API that developers have to get familiar with.<br />
              By splitting code and functionality into smaller modules it's easier to solve problems in your code and <strong>to work in a team on the same codebase</strong>.
              <br /><br />
              
              *Every module should have exactly one purpose and task to do. <br />
              *A module doesn't know about the outside logic of the application, and can be reused in different locations in situations (loose coupling).<br /><br />
              
              <strong>invariant</strong> - a statement about something that is held to be true, like a meta property of anything that's always true (or true under certain conditions).<br /><br />	
              
              <strong>read-only</strong> - An object that does not expose any way to change it. However, read-only objects are allowed to change.<br /><br />
              
              <strong>Imperative</strong> - Imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. brtag
              Ex. low level languages, since the way computer hardware is designed is to executre machine code, which is native to the computer, and written in an imperative style.<br /><br />
              
              <strong>Executable</strong> - a.k.a. "binary" - [machine] code that causes a computer to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions, as opposed to a data file which must be parsed by a program to be meaningful.<br /><br />
              
              <strong>scripts</strong> - programs written for a special run-time environment (like a browser or an OS) that <strong>automate the execution of tasks.</strong><br /><br />
              
              <strong>scripting language</strong> - a.k.a. "extension language" - very high-level (since they're about nabstraction" in the form of automating otherwise manual tasks).<br /><br />
              
              <strong>parsing</strong> - the process of analysing a string of symbols conforming to rules of "grammar" a.k.a. syntax. <br />
              So running a program through a parser means it will be checked to see if its code does anything.<br /><br />
              
              <strong>refactoring</strong> - restructuring existing code, a.k.a. changing the factoring, without changing the external behavior (like to make a program run more efficiently etc.) <br /><br />
              
              <strong>memoizing</strong> - an optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls (ex. recursion) and <strong>returning the cached result when the SAME *INPUT* occurs again.</strong> <br /><br />
              
              <strong>encapsulation</strong> - grouping of data and behavior into one entity. <br /><br />
              
              <strong>deep vs shallow copy</strong> (cloning) - <br />
              shallow - Duplicate as little as possible (like a minimum setting) <br /> 
              deep - When an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers (like a max setting on something).<br /><br />
              
              
              <strong>overhead</strong> - excess use of memory, bandwidth, or other resources read to perform a specific task ("aka engineering overhead"). <br /> <br/>
              
              <strong>use case</strong> - a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website i.e. specs for how a user interacts w a something. <br /><br />
              
              It can also be thought of as a list of actions / events (steps) defining the interaction between a role (ACTOR) and a system to achieve a goal. The "actor" can be a human or an external system.
              <br /><br />
              A customer must click on this, click on that, etc. <br />
              This data then gets sucked into the biz logic via a controller / service for example <br /> <br />
              
              
              <strong>dependency injection </strong> - where one object supplies the dependencies of another. <br />
              A <strong>dependency</strong> is an object that can be used (i.e. a <strong>service</strong>). <br />
              It's all about passing the service to the client rather than allowing the client to build/find the service. <br /><br />
              
              state management <br />
              strong vs weak type <br />
              dynamic vs static type <br />

            <code>
                // If array is empty or consists of one element then return this array since it is sorted.
                if (originalArray.length <= 1) {
                  return originalArray;
                }
            
                // Split array on two halves.

                // Sort two halves of split array
                const leftSortedArray = this.sort(leftArray);
                const rightSortedArray = this.sort(rightArray);
            
                // Merge two sorted arrays into one.
                return this.mergeSortedArrays(leftSortedArray, rightSortedArray);
              }
            
              mergeSortedArrays(leftArray, rightArray) {
                let sortedArray = [];
            
                // In case if arrays are not of size 1.

                  let minimumElement = null;
            
                  // Find minimum element of two arrays.
                  if (this.comparator.lessThanOrEqual(leftArray[0], rightArray[0])) {
                    minimumElement = leftArray.shift();
                  } else {
                    minimumElement = rightArray.shift();
                  }
            
                  // Call visiting callback.
                  this.callbacks.visitingCallback(minimumElement);
            
                  // Push the minimum element of two arrays to the sorted array.
                  sortedArray.push(minimumElement);
                }
            
                // If one of two array still have elements we need to just concatenate
                // this element to the sorted array since it is already sorted.
                if (leftArray.length) {
                  sortedArray = sortedArray.concat(leftArray);
                }

                return sortedArray;
              }
            }
            </code>
            
            Merge sort is based on divide-and-conquer.
            It's also based on the idea that arrays of multiple items can't be compared until they're sorted.<br /><br />
            Merge sort splits an array into two halves, recursively, until you reach a point in which multiple pairs of single-item arrays are compared to each other. <br /><br />
            
            1. Divide Step - <br />	
            If a given array A has zero or one element, simply return; it's already sorted! <br />
            Otherwise, split A[p .. r] into two subarrays A[p .. q], and A [q + 1 .. r]. Each one contains about half the elements of A[p .. r] - that is, q is the halfway point of A[p .. r].
            <br /><br />
            2. Conquer Step - <br />
            Conquer by recursively sorting the two new subarrays A[p .. q] and A[q + 1 ..r].
            <br /><br />
            3. Combine Step <br />
            Combine the elements back in A[p .. r] by merging the two newly sorted subarrays into a sorted sequence. To do this, define a procedure (function) MERGE(A, p, q, r).

            <h2>Basics</h2>
            
            <strong>Algorithm</strong> - a function that transforms an input data structure into a certain output data structure. The <strong>logic</strong> inside decides the transformation. <br /><br />
            
            The inputs and outputs should ideally be clearly defined as <strong>unit tests</strong>. A thorough analysis of the problem is needed. <br /><br />
            
            Things to consider: <br /><br />
            
            <li>What variables will be needed?</li>
            <li>How many loops and what kinds?</li>
            <li>Are there any methods that can help?</li>
            <li><strong>Edge</strong> case to consider?</li>
            <li>Can <strong>helper functions</strong> be extracted or abstracted? (an algorithm typically needs to be scalable)</li>
            <li>Should there be some kind of <strong>caching mechanisms?</strong></li>
            
            1. To make the problem more concrete, draw diagrams <br />
            2. When a high-level structure of the solution begins to appear, the pseudocode can begin. <br />
            3. Look ahead for opportunities to <strong>refactor</strong> and <strong>reuse</strong> code. <br />
            4. Sometimes, similar-behaving functions can be combined into a more general function that accepts an extra parameter. <br />
            5. Keeping functions <strong>pure</strong> to ease testing and maintenance also shows foresight. <br />
            6. Consider <strong>architectural</strong> and <strong>design patterns</strong> in your decisions. <br />
            7. Any time there's a "sum of the previous two numbers" (fibonacci, for example), recursion is the simplest approach. <br />
            8. Generally, memory optimizations (space) will need to be sacrificed for performance gains (time). <br />
            
            <h2>Big O Basics</h2>
              
              The most optimum algorithm scales in a constant time and space, meaning it doesn't care about the growth of its inputs. <br />
              The next best is logarithmic time or space, <br />
              then linear, <br />
              then linearithmic, <br />
              then quadratic, <br />
              then exponential, <br />
              and lastly factorial time or space. <br /><br />
              
              To assist in the calculation of <strong>runtime complexities</strong>, you approximate the scalability of an algorithm by extrapolating its input sizes towards infinity, before counting the number of operations required. <br />
              At this worst-case runtime upper-bound, you can drop coefficients and additive terms and retain only factors that dominate the function.<br />
              Just a few categories can describe the scalability of almost any algorithm.                    
            <h2>Javascript Data Structures</h2>
              
              <p>
              Without data structures, we have no objects by which to apply logic. <br />
              Without algorithms, objects cannot be transformed.
              </p>
              
              At the high level there are essentially three types of data structures: <br /><br />
              
              <li><strong>Stacks</strong> and <strong>Queues</strong> are "array-like" strucrures that differ only in how items are inserted and removed. These are the simplest in terms of complexity and can be constructed from Linked List.</li>
              <li><strong>Linked Lists,</strong> <strong>Trees,</strong> and <strong>Graphs</strong> are structures with <strong>nodes</strong> that keep <strong>references</strong> to other nodes.
              <li><strong>Hash Tables</strong></li> depend on <strong>hash functions</strong> to save and locate data.

            <h3>Arrays</h3>
                
              In Javascript, no other object has more utility mthods than arrays (sort, reverse, slice, splice, etc.) <br />
              Since arrays are zero-indexed, the last element occurs at <span class="inline-code">array.length - 1</span>. <br />
              Arrays are the most optimal  for indexing (pushing), but can be terrible at inserting, deleting (not popping), and searching. In Javascript, arrays can also grow dynamically.
            
              
            <h3>Stack</h3>
              
              The most important Stack in JS is the <strong>Call Stack,</strong> where we <strong>push</strong> in the <strong>scope</strong> of a function whenever we execute it. <br />
              <strong>Programatically it's just an array with two principled operations: push and pop</strong>. <br />
              Push <strong>adds</strong> elements to the <strong>top</strong> of the array, while Pop <strong>removes</strong> them from the same location. <br />
              Stacks follow the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) protocol.
              
            <h3>Queue</h3>
              
              Javascript is an <strong>event-driven</strong> programming language, making it possible to support <strong>non-blocking</strong> operations. <br /><br />
              Internally, the browser manages only one thread to run the entire JS code using the <strong>event queue</strong> to <strong>enqueue</strong> <span class="inline-code">listeners</span>, and the <strong>event loop</strong> to "listen" for the registered <span class="inline-code">events</span> . <br />
              To save CPU resources, listener functions dequeue and execute only when the call stack is empty. <br />
              <strong>Promises</strong> depend on this event-driven architecture to <strong>allow a synchronous-style execution of asynchronous codes that does not block other operations (non-blocking).</strong><br /><br />
              
              Programmatically speaking, queues are just arrays with two primary operations: unshift and pop. <br />
              Unshift <strong>enqueues</strong> items to the <strong>end</strong> of the array, while Pop <strong>dequeues</strong> them from the <strong>beginning</strong> of the array. <br />
              Queues follow the "First In, First Out" (FIFO) protocol.
            
            <h3>Linked List</h3>
              
              Like arrays, <strong>Linked Lists</strong> store data elements in a <strong>sequential</strong> order. <br />
              Instead of indeces, linked lists have <strong>pointers</strong> to other elements. <br />
              The first node is called the <strong>head</strong>, while the last node is called the <strong>tail</strong>. <br /><br />
              
              In a <strong>singly-linked list</strong> each node has only one pointer to the next node - here the head is where you begin the walk down the rest of the list. <br /><br />
              
              In a <strong>doubly-linked list</strong> a pointer to the <strong>previous</strong> node is also kept. Therefore you can also start from the tail and walk backwards toward the head. <br /><br />
              
              <h4>Advantages Over Arrays</h4>
              
              Linked lists have <strong>constant-time</strong> insertions and deletions because you can just update the pointers. <br />
              To do the same operations in arrays requires linear time, because subsequent items need to be shifted over. <br />
              Linked lists can also grow as long as there is space - even dynamic arrays that automatically resize can become incredivly expensive. There is a tradeoff, however: to lookup or edit an element in a linked list, you might have to walk the entire length which equates to linear time, while with array indeces such operations are trivial.
              
            <h3>Tree</h3>
              
              A <strong>Tree</strong> is like a linked list, however it keeps references to <i>multiple</i> <strong>child nodes</strong> in a hierarchical structure. That is, <strong>each node can have no more than one parent</strong>. <br />
              An example is the DOM, with a root html node that branches into the head and body nodes (html tags), which further subdivide into all familiar html tags. 
              
            <h4>Binary Search Tree</h4>
              
              This type of Tree is special, because each node can have no more than <strong>two</strong> children. The <strong>left child</strong> must have a value that is smaller than or equal to its parent, while the <strong>right child</strong> must have a value that's greater. <br /><br />
              
              This lets you search for any value in <strong>logarithmic</strong> time because you can ignore one-half of the branching with each iteration. The smallest and largest value can easily be found at the leftmost and rightmost leaf, respectively. <br /><br />
              
              Traversing though the tree can happen vertically or horizontally. <strong>Depth-First Traversal (DFT)</strong> in the vertical direction allows a recursive algorithm to be more elegant than an iterative one. Nodes can be traversed either pre-order, in-order, or post-order. Binary trees are optimal for <strong>sorting</strong>.
              <br /><br />
              
              With <strong>Breadth-First Traversal (BFT)</strong> in the horizontal direction, an iterative approach is more elegant than a recursive one. This requires the use of a queue to track all children nodes with each iteration. <br />
              <strong>If the shape of a tree is deeper than it is wide, then DFT is a better choice over BFT.</strong>
            
            <h4>Graph</h4>
              
              If a tree is free to have more than one parent then it becomes a <strong>Graph</strong>.<br />
              <strong>Edges</strong> that connect nodes together in a graph can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. Edges that have both <strong>direction</strong> and <strong>weight</strong> are analogous to <strong>vectors</strong>.
              
              Examples of graph structures:
              
              *Multiple inheritances in the form of mixins and data objects that have <strong>many-to-many</strong> relationships.
              *A social network and the Internet itself are also graphs.
              *The most complicated graph is our human brain, which <strong>neural networks</strong> attempt to replicate, to give machines superintelligence.
            
            <h3>Hash Table</h3>
              
              This is a <strong>dictionary-like structure that pairs keys to values.</strong><br />
              The location in memory of each pair is determined by a <strong>hash function</strong>, which:
              <br /><br />
              1. Accepts a <strong>key</strong>, and
              2. Returns the <strong>address</strong> where the pair should be inserted and retrieved.
              <br /><br />
              Collisions can occur if two or more keys convert to the same address.
              <br /><br />
              For robustness, <strong>getters</strong> and <strong>setters</strong> should anticipate these events to ensure that all data can be recovered, and that no data is overwritten.
              <br /><br />
              If you know your addresses will be in integer sequences you can simply use an Array to store the key-value pairs. For more complex <strong>address mappings</strong>, you can use <strong>Maps</strong> or <strong>Objects</strong>.
              <br /><br />
              If a tradeoff decision favors retrieval over storage, <strong>no other data structure can match the speed of hash tables for lookup, insertion, and deletion</strong>. This is why they're used everywhere from databases to servers to the client. Hash tables, and hash functions in particular, are crucial to the a. performance and b. security of software applications. <br /><br />
              The speed of database queries relies heavily on keeping tables of indeces that point to records in sorted order. E-commerce over HTTPS is safe only because hashing functions (MD5, SHA256) get used.
              
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              
              *Linked Lists are optimal for <strong>storage</strong>, and can be made into stacks and queues (linear time).
              *Hash tables are unmatched for <strong>search</strong> speed (constant time).
              *Tree structures lie somewhere in the middle (logarithmic time).
              *Only a graph can portray nature's most complex structures, like the human brain (polynomial time).

              <p>
              Hash function - Any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size.<br />
              The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash sums, or simply hashes.
              </p>
              
              <p>One use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup.
              <br /><br />
              Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file.</p>

              <h3>Project Management</h3>


              <h4>Basics</h4>

              *The size of the team and the roles needed can vary. <br />
              *Members on a team can fulfill one role or many.
              <br /><br />
              Projects are typically broken down into phases.<br />
              Each phase outlines the work that needs to be done and who's involved.<br />
              Typically, in order for a phase to be complete, specific deliverables need to have been completed o handed off.<br />
              However, some teams implement FAST TRACKING, or when phases overlap.<br />              

              <h4>Management Types</h4>

              <li>Communication management</li>
              <li>Cost management</li>
              <li>Human resource management</li>
              <li>Integration management</li>
              <li>Procurement management</li>
              <li>Quality management</li>
              <li>Risk management</li>
              <li>Scope management</li>
              <li>Time management</li>




              <h4>Project Lifecycle</h4>
              A lifecycle defines the BEGINNING and END of a project - it represents all of the phases together. <br />
              When defining the project's life cycle, the first phase is noted as step 0: Visioning and conceptualizing of a project. <br /><br />	

              Most projects have four or five phases but some may have more. <br /><br />

              Most common approaches are WATERFALL and AGILE. <br />
              Whatever your choice, you'll need to incorporate <strong>USER-CENTERED DESIGN (UCD) </strong>best practices and methods.

              <h4>The UCD Process</h4>

              At a high level, UCD includes the following steps: <br /><br />


              -Planning <br />
              -Collecting and analyzing data <br />
              -Writing content <br />
              -Designing and developing prototypes of the system <br />
              -Testing <br />

              <h4>Project Plan and Charter Agreement</h4>

              It's important to come up with a <strong>project plan</strong> the team agrees to upfront so it can serve as a reference point throughout the project. <br /><br />

              Most project plans include: <br /><br />

              -Objectives <br />
              -Scope, which correlates to the requirements <br />
              -Resources, including tech, budget, and TEAM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES <br />
              -Schedule <br />
              -Assumptions <br />
              -Dependencies <br />
              -Risk assessment and management plan <br />
              -Change control plan (?) <br /><br />

              <p>
              A <strong>charter agreement</strong> a typically one-page document that has the sponsor of the project sign off that they agree to the work to be done as outlined by the team in the project plan.
              </p>
              <p>            
              <strong>Schedules</strong> reflect the life cycle broken down into specific deliverables and touch points.
              It defines WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE and WHO IS THE POINT OF CONTACT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORK.
              </p>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
              <p>
              To save time in the future: <br />
              <li>Always check package versions</li>
              <li>Use <strong>--save</strong> or <strong>--save-dev</strong> to save to the package.json</li>
              <li>Can use <strong>--unsafe-perm</strong> to install problematic packages only if absolutely necessary</li>        
              </p>

            <h2>Package Management</h2>


                <h3>Ruby Gems vs npm Packages</h3>

                A Gemfile is Ruby's equivalent to package.json. newline

                Rubygems has an extension in the form of <strong>Bundler</strong>, whose sole purpose is dependency management. <br /><br />

                Instead of locally, dependencies are managed globally. Bundler also creates a Gemfile.lock, which lists every specific version of libraries. <br /><br />

                This way, version conflicts are taken care of, so when you need to recreate the environment for another developer or deployment, it's guaranteed to reinstall in pristine conditions (similar to package.json and package-lock). <br /><br />

                npm however installs locally, with nested dependencies. If you want npm to be global like Rubygems you can use <span class="inline-code">npm link</span>.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>Bundler</strong> - provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions needed. It's about solving dependency hell, ensuring the gems needed are present in development, staging, and production.

                <h3>Homebrew extensions</h3>

                <p>Homebrew installs packages to their own directory, then symlinks (symbolic links) their files into /usr/local.</p>

            <h2>Site Performance</h2>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                Sites have more features now than ever before, however many sites now struggle to achieve a high level of performance across a variety of network conditions and advices. <br /><br />
                
                Performance issues vary: at best, they might create small delays that are only briefly annoying to the end user. At worst, they can make the website completely inaccessible, unresponsive to user input, or both. <br />
                
                <h4>Retaining users</h4>
                
                Page speed has a massive impact, and low performance can have a negative impact on a business's goals.
                
                <h4>Improving conversions</h4>
                
                *DoubleClick found that publishers whose sites loaded within five seconds earned up to twice as much ad revenue than sites loading within 19 seconds.
                
                <h4>The user experience</h4>
                
                When sites ship a lot of code, browsers must use megabytes of the user's data plan in order to download code. Mobile devices have limited CPU power and memory, and often get overwhelmed with what we might consider unoptimized code.
                
                <h4>People</h4>
                
                Total page side has been steadily increasing since at least 2011. As the typical page sends more data, users must replenish their metered data plans more often, costing them money.
                
                <h4>Performance Metrics</h4>
                
                <strong>bounce rates</strong>
                <strong>pages per session</strong>
                <strong>page load time</strong>
                <strong>session-based conversion</strong>
                
                <h4>Common Solutions</h4>
                
                <li>Eliminate render-blocking resources</li>
                <li>Reduce Javascript execution time</li>

            <h2>JS Engines</h2>

                <strong>CHROME v8</strong> - a Javascript engine. JS engines are mostly used in web browsers.
                
                <strong>javascript engines</strong> - embedded in browsers and web servers (i.e. Node - what v8 is used in) to allow <strong>run-time compilation and execution of JS code</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>async</strong>.
                <br /><br />
                
                <strong>Node </strong> is a server-side execution environment built on <strong>Chrome's V8 JS runtime</strong>. <br /><br />
                
                <strong>just-in-time compilation</strong> - improves app performance at  <strong>
                runtime</strong> ( like a JIT *compiler*, which is what javascript engines, and therefore V8, and therefore Node, utilize). <br />
                JIT drawbacks - it does require processing time and memory usage. <br /><br />
                
                JVM (Java) for example calls THOUSANDS of methods when it first starts up.
                <br /><br />
                
                Node is an extension or next-level version of the  v8 engine in Chrome basically.
